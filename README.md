# Project Introduction
Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ This project is a testament to what can be achieved with a little help and a lot of determination. I built this recipe application from the ground up with guidance from Gemini, the AI assistant. It demonstrates how someone with very basic programming skills can create a fully functional, full-stack web application.

This app empowers you to:

Easily manage recipes: View, add, edit, and delete your favorite recipes.

Search with ease: Quickly find the recipes you're looking for.

Learn by doing: The entire project serves as a practical example of how frontend, backend, and containerization technologies work together.

This project is not just a collection of code; it's a guide to learning and a showcase of how modern tools can help anyone bring a creative idea to life.

# Recipe Application

A full-stack web application for managing and sharing recipes. This project is built using a modern stack and is fully containerized with Docker for easy setup and deployment.

## Features

- **View Recipes:** Browse through a collection of all available recipes.
- **Search:** Find specific recipes using the search bar.
- **Add New Recipes:** Create and save new recipes with ingredients, instructions, and images.
- **Edit & Delete:** Update or remove existing recipes.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is accessible and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express.js)
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your-GitHub-Repository-URL-Here]
    cd [Your-Repository-Name]
    ```

2.  **Start the Application:**
    Navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command. This will build the Docker images and start all the services (frontend, backend, and database).
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    The `--build` flag is crucial for the first run or after making changes to the code. On subsequent runs, you can just use `docker-compose up`.

3.  **Access the Application:**
    Once the containers are running, you can access the application in your web browser at:
    `http://localhost:3000`
